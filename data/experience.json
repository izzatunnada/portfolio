        "description": "During the internship program, I gained valuable experience in operating and programming Haiwell PLCs, from control logic design to hands-on system implementation. I also designed an intuitive and efficient HMI (Human-Machine Interface) interface to support user interaction with the system. As part of the project assignment, I co-designed and developed a PLC-based Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) system as a real application of modern industrial automation."
